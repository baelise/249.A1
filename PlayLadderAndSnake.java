// Assignment Description:
// This program is a Snakes and Ladders simulation game. A welcome message is 
// displayed and then the user is prompted for the number of players (between
// 2 and 4). If the user enters an invalid number 4 times the program terminates.
// If they enter a valid number of players the program prompts the user for the 
// Player's name. The program then calls a player order method, passing the entered
// names to the method. This method then rolls for each player and then places the 
// players in order, from highest roll to lowest. If two players roll the same number,
// a re-roll between those two players occurs, within the method as well. Once every 
// player has a unique roll number, the method sorts the players and displays the player
// order using a string array. The play method is then called, passing the string array
// of players to the method. The play method rolls for each player, one by one, and adds 
// the roll to the players positions (all players start at square 0). If the players lands 
// on a square with a snake or a ladder, the program moves the players up/down respectively,
// attaining these snake/ladder values from the two-dimensional array at the beginning of
// the LadderAndSnake class. If a player, at any point, rolls over 100, the player is 
// moved back by number of places the went over 100. Once a player has successfully reached 
// square 100, the player is declared a winner and a message is displayed. The game them terminates.
